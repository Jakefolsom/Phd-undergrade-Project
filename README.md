# Phd-undergrade-Project
## What is it?
During my undergrade I created this program for a PHd student's thesis. This program pull questions from a database and will keep score of the answers a user gives. Once it gets to the last section it will keep asking harder questions until the user answers incorrect. It will then move on to the next topic. After all topics and sections are complete it will calulate the score based on the mathematical formula the Phd student had ceated. It will then store the results in a database which can be viewed and analyzed at a later point.
